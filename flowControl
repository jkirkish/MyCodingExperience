	/*Programs use selection statements to choose among alternative courses of actions.  For 
	 * example suppose that the passing grade on the exam is 60.  We can write the pseudocode 
	 * statement "If students grade is greater than or equal to 60, Print Passed"  This logic determines 
	 * whether the condition "student's grade is greater than or equal to 60 is true.  If so, the print 
	 * statement executes. If condition is false, the print statement is false.
