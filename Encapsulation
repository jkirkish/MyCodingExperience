		/* 1)What is encapsulation?
		 *   Encapsulation is like putting something valuable inside a protective capsule 
		 *   The intent is to hide certain data to protect it from being seen from someone else
		 *   For example, only certain people may need to see your social security number in a bank acount
		 *   Encapsulation can be thought of as the packing of data and functions into a single component. 
		 *   The features of encapsulation are supported using classes in most object-oriented programming languages.
		 *   
		 * 2)What are advantages of it?
		 * You can take an internal and external view of an object
		 * The internal view is the structure the data, like the algorithms used by its methods
		 * 
		 * The external view is the interaction of the object with other objects in the program. The object is an encapsulated entity providing 
		 * services. These services define the interface to the object.
		 * 
		 * So one advantage is to group data code structure into one place and hide 
		 * irrelevant details from the user.  This practice is known as information hiding,
		 * where algorithms are invisible to portions of the system that do not need them.
		 * 
		 * 3)Write  program to perform encapsulation?
		 * 
		 * 
		 * 4)What are access specifiers or visibility modifiers?
		 * 
		 * 
		 * 
		 * Visibility modifiers is a java reserved word that specifies particular characteristics of a method or data vale to accomplish encapsulation
		 * 
		 * 
		 * 5)List visibility modifiers 
		 *   Private 
		 *   Protected
		 *   Public
		 *   Package or default
		 * 
		 * 6) Write in detail about all visibility modifiers?
		 * 
		 *   Private -accessed from anywhere
		 *   Protected-these members of base class are safeguarded in derived class
		 *   Public-accessed from anywhere
		 *   Package or default-only from within the package
		 * 
		 * 7) What is return type and return statement?
		 *      
		 *   Return type of a method indicates the tpe of value that the method sends back to the calling location
		 *   Void methods do not return a value
		 *   
		 *   The return statement specifies the value that will be returned.  The expression must conform to the return type.
		 *   Get methods are examples of a method that as a return type and statement.
